			<h2> Do the Buffalo Bills play better when there is more snow? </h2>
			<h4> Testing a Bills Mafia superstision. <br>By Brooke Dehn</h4>

			<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
			<p>Anyone who is a fan of the Buffalo Bills knows the superstition; the Bills play better in the snow. Fans anxiously cross their fingers and wish for snow during the fourth quarter of a close game. They even volunteer to dig out the stadium after a snowstorm, and pick up the players on snowmobiles to take them to the airport during driving bans. Like any other Bills fan, this is something I have believed all my life. This is what inspired me to do this project. Especially after getting closer and closer to a superbowl in the past few seasons and having some standout games, I wanted to know more. My hypothesis going into this project was that the Buffalo Bills performed better during seasons with a higher annual snowfall accumulation. Especially after the 2022 season where the team experienced multiple blizzards in the city of Buffalo and still managed to finish the season just 2 games shy of a superbowl, the Buffalo Bills are not scared of a little snow.</p>

			<h3>Findings</h3>
			<img src="Stadium Snow.jpeg" alt="Highmark Stadium covered in snow"> 
			<p>In this project data about the annual snowfall accumulation in Buffalo, New York from the National Weather Service, and data collected by Pro Football Reference on the performance of the Buffalo Bills dating back to 1970. Both of my data visualizations are line charts depicting the total number of points scored by the Buffalo Bills per season, and the total snowfall accumulation in Buffalo, New York per season. Due to my previous hypothesis, I expected to see that both lines on the graph would follow the same trend; an increase in points scored and total snowfall, or vice versa. Ultimately I did find an increase in performance by the Buffalo Bills based on total points scored, but because of the limitations of the data it is inconclusive as to if this improvement can be attributed to the winter weather in Buffalo, New York. Other factors that relate to the team’s performance include, but are not limited to, the coaches, newly drafted players, or injuries. This does not discount the effects that weather has on the player’s athletic performance. The Buffalo Bills have won some of their coldest games, like the 1994 game against the Los Angeles Raiders where the Buffalo Bills won the game 29-23 in below zero temperatures. During the 2022 season Buffalo, New York had a total snow accumulation of 133.6 inches of snow, and the Buffalo Bills scored 455 points making it to the playoffs, losing in the divisional round. This is more snow than the city has seen in nearly 30 years, and one of the Buffalo Bills’ better seasons considering the team has never won a superbowl.  In an interview with Steve Infanti, an adjunct professor of sports broadcasting at the Newhouse School, he stated how the weather gives the team an advantage when it comes to competing against teams from different climates. “I would say that they [the Buffalo Bills] are more accustomed to it [cold weather] than their opponents sometimes… they are better equipt to handle a bad weather game,” Infanti said. He goes on to say that weather can close the gap in talent between two teams, which is where the Buffalo Bills can make or break their game. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566070217301807"> A study </a> on cold acclimation and cognitive performance stated, “…cold acclimation can lessen the physiological and perceptual stress experienced during cold exposure”. This finding supports the idea that though the snow might not be as magical as the fanbase believes it to be for the Buffalo Bills, there is something to be said about the team being acclimated to playing in cold weather. At the end of the day playing football in such a harsh and cold environment is a difficult thing to do, and it does end up giving an advantage to the players when it comes down to winning the game.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Though I may have just ruined the magic of the snow superstition for the Bills Mafia, they can all rest their heads knowing that the snow still can be a good thing for the team. My original hypothesis may not have been completely supported, but that idea was not completely off the beaten path from the conclusion we ended up coming to. I have concluded that the snow does not automatically make the Buffalo Bills perform better athletically as an isolated variable, but rather that living and training in the harsh Buffalo weather gives the Buffalo Bills an overall advantage, mentally and physically. </p>
